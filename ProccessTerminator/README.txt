=============================
ProcessTerminator is a user-friendly utility designed to simplify the process of closing running applications. With ProcessTerminator, you can manually select and close applications of your choice with just a few clicks. Additionally, it offers the convenience of automatic closure based on two modes: duration and scheduled time. In duration mode, you can specify the desired time duration, and the app will automatically close the selected application after that duration has elapsed. In scheduled time mode, you can set a specific time for the application to close. Whether you need to free up system resources, manage application usage, or automate the closure process, ProcessTerminator provides a hassle-free solution for terminating running applications.
